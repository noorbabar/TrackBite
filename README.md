# 🥗 TrackBite - A Wellness Companion

TrackBite is a web application that aims to help users build sustainable nutrition habits through education, personalisation, and meal planning!

We believe:
- **Education > Tracking**: Understanding nutrition beats obsessive logging
- **Flexibility > Perfection**: Rough targets are more sustainable than strict numbers
- **Personalisation > Generic**: Your goals and body composition matter
- **Real Food > Abstract Numbers**: Focus on ingredients, not just calories
