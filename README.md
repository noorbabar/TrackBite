# TrackBite

**A Wellness Companion for Women**

[Live Demo](https://track-bite.vercel.app)

I'm passionate about fitness and nutrition, and as a woman constantly researching this field, I built TrackBite to help others navigate what I know is confusing: because creating tools that actually make an impact matters to me.

## The Problem

Hitting your macros is hard. Understanding how your cycle affects training is harder. Finding workout splits that actually work for your goals? Even harder.

Most fitness apps treat nutrition and training as separate problems. They ignore how hormones affect energy, recovery, and performance. Generic meal plans don't account for your grocery stores or dietary needs.

TrackBite brings it all together: nutrition education, personalised macros, cycle aware training, and soon, complete workout programming designed for women. Plan your meals here, & track them in MyFitnessPal.

## What It Does

**Smart Macro Calculator** → Personalised macros using Mifflin-St Jeor BMR based on goals, body composition, activity level

**Real Time Meal Builder** → 70+ verified ingredients from Australian groceries with live macro tracking as you build

**Recipe Auto Matching** → Suggests complete meals based on ingredients you select

**Pre Made Meal Plans** → Ready to use meals with health benefits, cooking instructions, macro breakdowns

**Dietary Filters** → Halal, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, store specific filtering

**Cycle Aware Training** → Phase specific training and nutrition recommendations synced to your menstrual cycle

**Education Hub** → Guides on protein targets, macro basics, progress tracking for complete beginners

**Coming Soon:**

- Women focused workout splits (strength, hypertrophy, performance)
- Expanded grocery store coverage (more Australian stores + international options)
- Progressive overload tracking
- Training adjustments based on cycle phase and energy levels

## How It Works

**Goal Based Nutrition**  
Different goals need different approaches:

- Muscle Gain → 1.8-2.2g protein/kg bodyweight, higher carbs for energy
- Fat Loss → 1.2-2g protein/kg, minimum fat for hormones (0.8g/kg), calorie deficit
- Performance → 55% carbs for athletic performance, balanced protein/fat
- Maintenance → Balanced split for weight stability

**Cycle Aware Wellness**  
Your hormones affect everything. TrackBite adjusts training intensity, volume, and nutrition recommendations based on your cycle phase. Higher intensity during follicular phase when energy peaks, modified training during luteal phase when recovery needs increase.

**Real Ingredients, Real Stores**  
All nutritional data verified from actual Australian product packaging. Store specific filtering shows only items from your preferred groceries. Expanding to more stores and international options.

Built mobile first because most people plan meals on their phones.

## Why I Built This

Trying to hit macros as a beginner is frustrating. Generic calculators don't account for actual goals or how your body responds. Cycle tracking exists, but nothing integrates nutrition and training adjustments together.

Women need tools that understand how hormones affect performance, not generic fitness apps designed for men. I wanted something that educates first, tracks second, and actually considers how real people live, train, and feel throughout the month.

## Current Status

**Working:** 70+ verified ingredients, goal based macro calculation, real time meal building, pre made meal plans, recipe auto matching, dietary/store filtering, cycle aware training

**In Progress:** Improving recipe auto matching intelligence, adding more meals and ingredients, refining UI/UX for faster meal building

## What's Next

**Short-term:** Women focused workout splits, expanded grocery stores, progressive overload tracking

**Medium-term:** Recipe community sharing, restaurant macro finder, training program library

**Long-term:** AI powered meal and workout recommendations, cycle synced periodisation
